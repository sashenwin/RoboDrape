# RoboDrape

Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an automated blinds system using an Arduino Uno board, a photocell, and various components. The system is designed to address the common issue of individuals forgetting to close their blinds, leading to privacy concerns, energy wastage, and exposure to external elements.

Components Used

Arduino Uno board
Breadboard
Photocell
Resistor
Full-Bridge Motor Driver Dual
Wall Charger
USB Cable A to B
DC Motor
Wires

Setup Instructions

Connect the Arduino Uno board to a laptop using the USB Cable A to B.
Connect the breadboard to the Arduino Uno board, and also connect the Full-Bridge Motor Driver Dual to the breadboard.
Supply power to the Full-Bridge Motor Driver Dual using a wall charger.
Connect the photocell to the breadboard.
Connect the DC motor to the Full-Bridge Motor Driver Dual using connecting wires.
Verify and upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno board.

Functionality

Once the setup is complete and the code is uploaded, the automated blinds system will:

Open the blinds when light is detected by the photocell.
Close the blinds when there is no light detected.

How It Works

The system utilizes the Arduino Uno board to control the DC motor through the Full-Bridge Motor Driver Dual based on the input received from the photocell. The photocell senses ambient light levels, triggering the opening or closing of the blinds accordingly.
